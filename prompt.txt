To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report related to an incorrect account rating for the account with [INSERT CREDITOR'S NAME]. The report reflects a delinquency, which is erroneous, as all payments have been made on time. This inaccuracy has negatively impacted my credit score, and I demand its immediate investigation and correction.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and complete information. The Metro 2 standards further reinforce the need for compliance in reporting consumer information. The continued reporting of this false delinquency violates these legal obligations.

I request the following actions be taken immediately:

Proof of Delinquency: I demand full documentation that supports the claimed delinquency for the account in question. This should include any relevant statements or communications that verify such an issue.

Verification of Permissible Purpose: Provide evidence that this account rating and related inquiry were made in compliance with the permissible purposes outlined by the FCRA.

Immediate Removal of Inaccurate Information: If you cannot provide the necessary evidence, I expect the immediate removal of this inaccurate account rating from my credit report.

I also request you complete this investigation within the legally required 30-day period, as stipulated by the FCRA. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in further action being taken.

For reference, my personal details are as follows:

Name: [Your Full Name]
Address: [Your Address]
SSN (last 4 digits): [Your SSN]
Date of Birth: September 03, 1992
I expect prompt attention to this matter, as the accuracy of my credit report is of the utmost importance.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this request. Please confirm in writing that this dispute has been resolved and that the necessary corrections have been made.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
