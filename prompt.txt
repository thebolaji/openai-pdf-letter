To whom it may concern:

I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information reported on my credit profile. As a consumer, I have the legal right to challenge and request verification of any details that I believe are not accurate on my credit report, as required under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Metro 2 guidelines.

The data you are reporting must be fully documented, validated, and comply with all federal and state regulations before being included in my credit report. Currently, the following information does not meet these standards, and I am requesting that it be corrected or removed:

Personal Information:

Name: My only name is {{NAME}}, and your records must reflect this accurately. Any variation or incorrect names must be deleted.

Address: The correct current address is {{ADDRESS}}. Any previous or unverified addresses should be removed from your system as they do not comply with FCRA or Metro 2 standards.

I also request proof of a permissible purpose for any inquiries on my report. You are required by law to provide documentation confirming the legitimacy of all inquiries made.

Please ensure that your response to this dispute is both timely and compliant with all relevant regulations. Failure to do so may lead to further action, including legal consultation, to protect my consumer rights.

I look forward to receiving confirmation that these errors have been corrected and an updated credit report within 30 days.

Sincerely,
{{NAME}}
{{ADDRESS}}
SSN: {{SSN}}
DOB: {{DOB}}
